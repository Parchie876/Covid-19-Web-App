                  <h2>What Is Coronavirus?</h2>
                  <h6>
                    Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease
                    caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
                  </h6>
                  <p>
                    Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience
                    mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without
                    requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with
                    underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease,
                    diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more
                    likely to develop serious illness. The best way to prevent
                    and slow down transmission is be well informed about the
                    COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads.
                    Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your
                    hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not
                    touching your face. The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily
                    through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when
                    an infected person coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s important that
                    you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by
                    coughing into a flexed elbow). At this time, there are no
                    specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there
                    are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential
                    treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated information
                    as soon as clinical findings become available.

                  There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease
                  2019 (COVID-19). The best way to prevent illness is to avoid
                  being exposed to this virus. The virus is thought to spread
                  mainly from person-to-person

                <p>
                  Data from published epidemiology and virologic studies provide
                  evidence that COVID-19 is primarily transmitted from
                  symptomatic people to others who are in close contact through
                  respiratory droplets, by direct contact with infected persons,
                  or by contact with contaminated objects and surfaces
                </p>

                      <p>
                        Coronaviruses can be transmitted from person to person,
                        usually after close contact with an infected patient,
                        for example, in a household workplace, or health care
                        centre.

                        Some medical procedures can produce very small droplets
                        (called aerosolized droplet nuclei or aerosols) that are
                        able to stay suspended in the air for longer periods of
                        time. When such medical procedures are conducted on
                        people infected with COVID-19 in health facilities,
                        these aerosols can contain the COVID-19 virus.

                        release droplets of infected fluid. Most of these
                        droplets fall on nearby surfaces and objects - such as
                        desks, tables or telephones. People could catch COVID-19
                        by touching contaminated surfaces or objects â€“ and then
                        touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
